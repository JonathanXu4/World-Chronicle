# World-Chronicle
## A worldbuilding app

### A file organization, viewing, and creation app made for storing and manipulating rich text with a custom designed UI

### This app can create wikia-like pages and categorize them into folders. Users can navigate through their folder hierarchy and manipulate text as needed.
Pages created using this app can be viewed, edited, and deleted at will. The same is true with folders. This app was something I have always wanted to make. I designed everything myself, from the planning to the final product.
### This app is made using Qt and C++
### The app has some issues with its interface and lacks a rich-text editor (although it can take rich-text from other sources)
### This app taught me everything I wanted to know about what is needed for creating a worldbuilding app. The creation of the interface took a lot of work and I received very useful peer feedback.
### If I were to recreate this app, I would change the file organization to be more stable. I would also add in a rich-text editor. Initially I tried to do so, but it turned out to be a much greater project than I anticipated, to the extent that the rich=text editor would take longer to create than the entire worldbuilding app. Finally, I would change the color-scheme to be better and more accessible
